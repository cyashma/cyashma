Yep, those numbers are as accurate as it gets. It’s like I’m the ghostwriter of GitHub. But hey, at least I'm consistent, right? 🌟

## Thanks for Visiting!

I know, I know… my GitHub is basically a ghost town. I swear I have projects, they're just... not ready for the world yet. Or maybe I’m just lazy. Who knows? 👻💤
